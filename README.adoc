= Jmemory

A simple memory game for mobile, written in Google's cross-platform https://flutter.dev[Flutter] toolkit.

The 'j' at the front of the name is just to differentiate it from all the other memory games.
Or it could be j for Java, in which a few bits were initially prototyped.
Or it could the the j from https://darwinsys.com/andrej[Andrej, the son I lost to Type 1 Diabetes].
